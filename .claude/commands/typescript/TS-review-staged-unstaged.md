## Review Focus Areas

1. **TypeScript Code Quality**
   - Strict TypeScript usage with explicit types
   - No `any` types - use `unknown` if type is truly unknown
   - Proper type imports with `import type { }` syntax
   - Component props interfaces defined
   - React types properly used (ReactElement, FC, PropsWithChildren)
   - Following TypeScript strict mode compliance

2. **React-Specific Patterns**
   - Functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
   - React 19 features usage (Actions, use() API, Suspense)
   - Custom hooks for reusable logic
   - Proper component composition and prop drilling avoidance
   - Context API usage where appropriate
   - Error boundaries for error handling

3. **Performance & Bundle Optimization**
   - Code splitting with React.lazy and dynamic imports
   - Memoization with useMemo and useCallback where needed
   - Vite bundle optimization and chunking strategies
   - Bundle size considerations
   - Avoiding unnecessary re-renders

4. **Security & Validation**
   - Input validation with Zod schemas
   - Environment variables prefixed with VITE_ for client exposure
   - XSS prevention and sanitization
   - No hardcoded secrets in client-side code
   - API integration with proper error handling

5. **State Management**
   - Local state with useState for component-specific data
   - Context API for cross-component state
   - Server state with TanStack Query or similar
   - Proper state updates without mutations

6. **Package Management**
   - Consistent package manager usage (npm/pnpm/yarn)
   - Proper dependency management
   - No unused dependencies
   - Correct dev vs runtime dependencies

7. **Code Structure & Architecture**
   - Components under 200 lines maximum
   - Functions under 50 lines with single responsibility
   - Proper separation of concerns
   - Feature-based organization
   - Vertical slice architecture followed

8. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
   - Vitest configuration and tests
   - 80%+ test coverage maintained
   - Component tests using React Testing Library
   - Integration tests for user flows
   - Proper mocking of external dependencies

9. **Build & Development**
   - `npm run type-check` passes with zero errors
   - ESLint compliance with zero warnings
   - Prettier formatting applied
   - Vite production build succeeds
   - No React hydration errors

10. **Documentation & Maintenance**
    - Clear component interfaces
    - Proper prop descriptions
    - CLAUDE.md updates for new patterns/dependencies
    - README updates if needed
