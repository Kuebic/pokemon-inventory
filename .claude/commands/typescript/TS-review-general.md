# General React/TypeScript/Vite Codebase Review

Perform a comprehensive review of the entire React/TypeScript/Vite codebase focusing on architecture, patterns, and best practices.

Review scope: $ARGUMENTS

If no specific scope provided, review the entire codebase.

## Review Process

1. **Codebase Analysis**
   - Analyze overall project structure and architecture
   - Review component organization and modularity
   - Check for consistency across the codebase
   - Identify technical debt and improvement opportunities

2. **Pattern Consistency**
   - Ensure consistent use of React 19 patterns and hooks
   - Validate TypeScript strict mode compliance
   - Check for consistent component and file naming conventions
   - Review import/export patterns and module resolution

3. **Performance Assessment**
   - Evaluate bundle size and Vite optimization
   - Review React memoization and rendering optimization
   - Check for unnecessary re-renders
   - Assess code splitting and lazy loading implementation

## Review Focus Areas

### 1. **Architecture & Structure**
   - Feature-based folder structure
   - Component organization (presentational vs container)
   - Custom hooks organization
   - API integration patterns
   - Proper separation of concerns with vertical slicing

### 2. **TypeScript Quality**
   - Strict mode compliance across all files
   - Type safety with no `any` types
   - Interface definitions for all props
   - Proper use of React types (ReactElement, FC, etc.)
   - Generic usage and type inference from schemas

### 3. **React-Specific Patterns**
   - React 19 features usage (Actions, use() API)
   - Hook patterns and custom hooks
   - State management approach
   - Context API usage
   - Component composition patterns

### 4. **Performance & Optimization**
   - Vite bundle optimization and chunking
   - React.lazy and Suspense usage
   - Memoization patterns (useMemo, useCallback)
   - Virtual DOM optimization
   - HMR (Hot Module Replacement) configuration

### 5. **Security & Validation**
   - Environment variable management
   - Content Security Policy implementation
   - Input validation patterns
   - API security measures
   - Zod schema consistency

### 6. **Code Quality Standards**
   - Component size limits (200 lines max)
   - Function complexity and cognitive load
   - Code duplication assessment
   - Error boundary implementation
   - Console usage and debugging practices

### 7. **Testing Coverage**
   - Vitest configuration and usage
   - Component test coverage
   - API route testing
   - Integration test quality
   - Mock usage patterns

### 8. **Dependencies & Tooling**
   - npm/pnpm/yarn usage consistency
   - Dependency management and updates
   - Vite configuration and plugins
   - Development tooling setup
   - ESLint and Prettier configurations

### 9. **Documentation & Maintenance**
   - Code documentation quality
   - README completeness
   - Component prop documentation
   - API documentation
   - CLAUDE.md updates

### 10. **Standards Compliance**
   - ESLint configuration and compliance
   - Prettier formatting consistency
   - TypeScript strict mode adherence
   - Build process compliance
   - Pre-commit hook effectiveness
